### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I am a 21-year-old computer science student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I am drawn to the problem solving, logic and rewarding nature of solving problems with code. I am particularly interested in the application of machine learning & artificial inteligence in the medical ðŸ’“ & business settings ðŸ“ˆ and in the ways they can be used to create business insights and improve diagnostic techniques. I also pride myself on my relentless persistence; I cannot start something without seeing it through to completion. I am looking to gain more industry experience and bring this passion, drive and creativity to the workplace where I can use it to make a meaningful impact.
