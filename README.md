### Hi there 👋

- I am 20-year-old computer science student at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. I came into college as a biology major, but quickly realized computer science to be my calling.  I am drawn to the logic, problem solving and sense that solving problems with code seems more like a solving a puzzle than a chore. 

- Within the realm of computer science, I have garnered an interest in computational medicine 💓 and data science 📈 . 

- I’m aiming to gain more hands on experience in these fields via collaboration 👯, competitions 🏁 and coursework ✏️!
