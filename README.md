### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I am a 21-year-old computer science student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I came into college as a biology major but quickly realized computer science to be my passion. I am drawn to the problem solving, logic and rewarding nature of solving problems with code. I am particularly interested in the application of machine learning & natural language processing in the medical ðŸ’“ & business settings ðŸ“ˆ and in the ways they can be used to create business insights and improve diagnostic techniques. I pride myself on my relentless persistence; I cannot start something without seeing it through to completion. 

- I also am passionate about sports, food and being outdoors. I am actively involved on campus; I play on the UNC Ice Hockey Team and am a member of the Alpha Epsilon Delta (AED) chapter at my college, a pre-health society that I volunteer with though. 
-
- Lastly, I am looking to gain more industry experience and bring my passion, drive and creativity to the workplace where I can use it to make a meaningful impact.
