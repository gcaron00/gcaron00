### Hi there 👋

- I am 20-year-old computer science student at the University of North Carolina Chapel hill. I came into college as a biology major, but quickly realized computer science 💻 to be my calling.  I am drawn to the ###logic, problem solving and sense that solving problems with code seems more like a satisfying puzzle than a chore.
